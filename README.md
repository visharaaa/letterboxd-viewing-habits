# 🎬 Letterboxd Viewing Habits Analysis

This project explores my personal movie-watching and rating habits using data exported from Letterboxd.  
The goal is to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) while uncovering insights about my film preferences, rating behaviour, and trends over time.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was exported directly from my Letterboxd account and includes:
- Movie titles and release years
- Ratings
- Watch dates
- Diary entries and optional tags

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis & Visualisations
The notebook includes:
- Distribution of movie ratings
- Number of movies watched per year
- Average rating trends over time
- Highest-rated and lowest-rated movies
- Movies watched by release decade
- Summary statistics of viewing habits

## 📈 Key Insights
- Visualised how my rating behaviour has changed over time
- Identified eras of film I watch most frequently
- Highlighted my most and least favoured movies based on ratings


## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add genre-based or director-based analysis
- Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit)
- Compare rating trends across different time periods

## 📌 Notes
This project is part of my data science learning journey and portfolio.  
All analysis is based on personal viewing data.
